Helix Framework, version 0.01
=============================

The Helix Framework is intended to turn a headache of web user interface 
development into something easy and full of fun. The main goal of the project is
to ease the creation of various web-based backends and systems such as project 
management systems, customer relationship management systems, online payment 
services and so on. You can use this framework for web site creation too, but it
isn't recommended - try to use another powerful tools, that are intended for 
this task (for example, Typo3 CMF, Moveable Type or, say, Wordpress).
